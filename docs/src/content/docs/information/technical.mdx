The following are some technical information about the API itself.

<Aside>
Because the API is currently under development and demand is uncertain, most of the storage and hosting solutions are simple and not suited for high demand.

All the backend might be refactored in the future to accommodate more requests and data, if needed.

## Hosting
The API is hosted on Vercel, using serverless functions to handle the requests. 
All the requests are subject to Vercel's rate limiting, which is currently set to `100` requests per minute.

Image hosting is done through GitHub, using the same repository as the API itself.

## Data Storage
The data is stored in a JSON file, which is read and parsed by the serverless functions on each request.

Because of the small size of the data, this solution is enough for the current demand. If the demand increases, the data storage solution might be refactored to a more robust solution.
