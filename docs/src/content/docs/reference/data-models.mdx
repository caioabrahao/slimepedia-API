## Introduction
All the data is structured in a way that is easy to understand and work with. Below you can find all the data models that are used in the API.

## Slimes
The Slimepedia API is all about slimes, so it makes sense to start with the Slime data model. Here is how the Slime data model is structured:

``` json
"slimes": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Pink Slime",
        "diet": ["Fruits", "Vegetables", "Meat"],
        "favoriteFood": "None",
        "habitat": "Everywhere",
        "features": [
          "Very common and friendly",
          "Can eat anything"
        ]
      },
```

### Data Types
| Value | Type | Description | Example Value
|-----------|---|-------------|---------------|
| `id`  | number | Unique identifier for the slime   | `1` |
| `name`  | string | The slime's name            | `Pink Slime` |
| `diet`   | array | The slime's dietary preferences          | `["Fruits", "Vegetables"]` |
| `favoriteFood`  | string | The slime's favorite food | `none` |
| `habitat`   | string | Where the slime is commonly found        | `Everywhere` |
| `features`   | array | Additional details about the slime | `["Very common and friendly"]` |
