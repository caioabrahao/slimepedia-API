## Introduction
Welcome to the Slimepedia API documentation! With this API you can create whatever your heart desires that is related to Slime Rancher data.

This is a **consumption only** API, meaning only the HTTP GET method will work.

**Currently this API is still a Work in Progress!!** The development is documentation-driven, so many already documented features may not work (as accordingly labeled). Check Versioning Information Here.

## Key Features
